# Preface

Predicting is making claims about something that will happen, often based on information from past and from current state.

Everyone solves the problem of prediction every day with various degrees of success. For example weather, harvest, energy consumption, movements of forex (foreign exchange) currency pairs or of shares of stocks, earthquakes, and a lot of other stuff needs to be predicted.

now I am taking course to Wharton's Business Analytics: From Data to Insights program! 


Week 2: Module Introduction and Instructions
By the end of Week 2 - Descriptive Analytics: Describing and Forecasting Future Events, you should be able to:

Use historical data to estimate forecasts for future events using trends and seasonality
Calculate the descriptive sample statistics for demand distributions
Discuss drawbacks of using Moving Averages Forecasting
Key Activities for Week 2
Videos 1-29
Practice Quiz 1: Newsvendor Concepts
Practice Quiz 2: Moving Averages
Practice Quiz 3: Trends and Seasonality
Week 2: Knowledge Check
Assignment 2: iD Fresh Food Case Study
All of the above activities should be completed by Thursday, July 14, 2022, by 4:29 PM UTC.

Spreadsheet Models

In this week, Professor Veeraraghavan uses Excel spreadsheets to demonstrate some of the forecasting models. The spreadsheets that he uses are added in the respective video pages.

You can also find all the spreadsheets collated in the Week 2: Spreadsheets page along with their solution files. For the best learning experience, we recommend that you work on the spreadsheet models along with the professor before you download the solution files.

# Predictive Analytics

With classification, deep learning is able to establish correlations between, say, pixels in an image and the name of a person. You might call this a static prediction. By the same token, exposed to enough of the right data, deep learning is able to establish correlations between present events and future events. The future event is like the label in a sense. Deep learning doesn’t necessarily care about time, or the fact that something hasn’t happened yet. Given a time series, deep learning may read a string of number and predict the number most likely to occur next.

## notes

besides of following  "law of proability","Probability: Independent Events", there are still "Saying "a Tail is due", or "just one more go, my luck is due to change" is called The Gambler's Fallacy" existed.
